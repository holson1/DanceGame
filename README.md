# SwapStepper (working name) 

SwapStepper is a JavaScript rhythm game in which the player must catch colored orbs in their matching-colored traps to the beat of the music. Different colored orbs may come from different directions, so you'll have to be quick on your feet and rotate the "catcher" to keep your traps in line. The game accepts "charts" in the form of arrays of orbs to create at specific beats, or the game can also generate orbs in a random pattern at a specific BPM.
